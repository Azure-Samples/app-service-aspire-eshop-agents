# External Inventory Service Configuration  
# REQUIRED for local development: Base URL to your external inventory service
# The system will automatically append endpoints:
# - /api/inventory (for REST API inventory queries)
# Note: MCP functionality won't work locally - only works when deployed to Azure
EXTERNAL_INVENTORY_URL=https://your-inventory-service.azurewebsites.net

# Local Development Environment
ASPNETCORE_ENVIRONMENT=Development

# Note: Azure AI Foundry configuration is not needed for local development
# since chat functionality only works when deployed to Azure with managed identity.
# The deployed App Service gets its AI configuration automatically from Azure.
